* [2016-09-23 Fri] Cool Science Image contest

I created this image of Madison's lakes using hyperspectral imagery
from NASA's [[http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/][AVIRIS sensor]] for the [[http://news.wisc.edu/cool-science-images-2016/][Cool Science Image Contest]].  I threw
it together the week before the contest and was very pleased to be
selected, but I wish that it had been more related to the science that
I do.  It is a minimum noise fraction transformation which is a way to
transform/condense the data from the ~250 bands into the 3 visible
channels (rgb) for maximum information viewing. Originally I intended
to create an image over land, but had great difficulty getting the
mosaicing of the 3 flightlines to be seamless.  You can see the band
across the northern part of lake Mendota from fox bluff to warner bay
that is due to image processing, not something real in the water.  The
image is no doubt cool, but I wish I could say more what the colors
meant (If you're a limnologist and see some meaning, please let me
know).  I think that pink may be related to sand, and green to bright
reflections on the water.  There's probably some algae detection going
on too.  My goal for next year is to make an image that is heavier on
the science and still very cool.

* [2016-09-20 Tue] Field work in northern Wisconsin

Field work provides the opportunity to be outside, help out on
lab-wide projects, and to learn about new research that isn't exactly
in my wheelhouse.  September 8-10 I went to the north woods to help
collect foliar samples as part of a NEON and Townsend lab project to
ultimately predict foliar traits such as morphology, pigments, and
other chemical constituents from hyperspectral imagery to create maps
of these traits.  This was the first year of a five year project.
There's much more to the science behind the goal.  But the aim of this
post is not to explain all that, but rather, to share some images and
the joy of being in the north woods.

* [2016-08-02 Tue] Making this website                              :orgmode:
I use emacs org-mode as the core application for my research.  It
makes sense to use the great org publishing features to create a
website without having to learn many new skills.  I had considered
using jekyll, but ultimately realized that I could make a website that
is just as beautiful and functional with emacs org-mode.

I've looked at tons of websites made with org-mode.  I like [[http://cs.unm.edu/~eschulte/][Eric
Schulte's]] best for an academic personal page, and I wanted to use the
[[http://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html][org-info.js]] for a blog with keyboard shortcuts for navigation and
search.

If you're not familiar with [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][org mode]], check it out.

If you are already familiar with org mode, spend twenty minutes
reading about [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#Exporting][exporting to html]] and [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][publishing]].  The manual is pretty
clear.  Once you have a published webpage, check out some css
stylesheets from other org sites that you like.  [[file:data/eric.css][Mine]] is a modified
version of the stylesheet of eric schulte, who I asked permission from
to use.

I spent no more 3 hours setting up the site.  Deciding that this was the
approach I wanted to take and generating the content took a couple
days.

You can clone the github [[https://github.com/TedwardErker/webpage][repo]] to see how I have it set up.

It is great to be able to work on the content of the website in a very
familiar way and export it to the internet with one command.  Amazing.

* [2016-08-01 Mon] Removing Stuck Aluminum Seatpost from a Steel Frame :bike:

*** In short:
Use a sodium hydroxide solution with proper protection and
ventilation. Be patient.  Use rubber stoppers to block holes in frame (bottom bracket
and water bottle braze-ons.

*** In long:
My seatpost had been stuck in my steel frame for years.  Fortunately
it was at the proper height, so it didn't bother me.  When my headset
broke and needed to be replaced, I figured I'd take care of the
seatpost at the same time.  I wasted an incredible amount of time
trying to remove the seatpost and ruined my paint in the process which
required a costly repowdering.  This post is to share my experience so
that you don't have to go through the same thing.

**** What didn't work:
1) Freezing
2) Ammonia
3) Pipe wrench with 5 foot bar
4) combinations of the above
5) Tying it between two trees and trying to pull it apart with 3 men and a
   6-1 mechanical advantage system.
#+CAPTION: We pulled hard, but failed
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt none :title trying to pull seatpost out :align center :height 300
[[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/pull_apart.jpg]]
**** What did work:
1) Remove everything from the frame except the seatpost
2) Use a hacksaw to remove seat and create hole to pour solution
   down.  Leave as much of the post as possible to reduce splashing,
   while still creating a large hole to pour solution
   down. [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/post_in_frame.jpg][post in frame]], [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/side_post_in_frame.jpg][side view]]
3) Stop up bottom bracket and braze-ons (any holes that will let the
   sodium hydroxide leak out of the seat tube) with rubber or cork
   stoppers.  I got many of different sizes for less than a dollar at
   the hardware store.
4) Place frame in well ventilated area on something to catch any
   spills (I used a plastic sled in my driveway). [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/setup.jpg][setup]]
5) Add sodium hydroxide salt to water (not water to salt).  I did this
   in an old milk jug.  Sodium hydroxide is sold at your local
   hardware store as lye or drain cleaner.  Check chemical composition
   to verify it is NaOH.  I didn't measure the concentration of the
   solution that I used, but you don't want it to be so concentrated
   that it bubbles violently out of seat tube and destroys your paint.  Also,
   the dissolving of NaOH is exothermic and the milk jug will get
   quite warm, or hot if it's very concentrated.
6) Pour solution into seat tube.  The solution needs to be up to the
   top of the tube so that the part of the post inside the tube will
   dissolve, but filling it up this high risks spashes.  Fill up the
   tube part way to make sure there isn't a ton up bubbling and
   splashing, then fill up to top of _tube_ (not post).  If you didn't saw off too
   much of the post, this length of post sticking out of tube will
   help give you a splash buffer.
   [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/bubbling.jpg][I cut mine too short and the paint was destroyed]]
7) Be patient.  My seat post wall was quite thick, at least 2 mm.
   This will take a long time to dissolve.  Wait until the solution is
   finished reacting with aluminum (you can hear the production of
   hydrogen gas), which may take a few hours.  Then pour out the
   solution from your frame and dispose of the dark grey liquid
   (because I wasn't sure if the NaOH was completely used, I added
   vinegar in an attempt to neutralize the base).
8) Repeat steps 5-7 until the post is completely dissolved or you
   can pull the post out.

**** I had apex custom coating in Monona, WI repaint my frame.
They did a great job and the price was lower than everywhere else I
looked, but it still wasn't cheap.  Don't let the NaOH stay on your
frame long!
