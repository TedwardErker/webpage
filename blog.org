* [2016-08-02 Tue] Making this website                              :orgmode:
I use emacs org-mode as the core application for my research.  It
makes sense to use the great org publishing features to create a
website without having to learn many new skills.  I had considered
using jekyll, but ultimately realized that I could make a website that
is just as beautiful and functional with emacs org-mode.

I've looked at tons of websites made with org-mode.  I like [[http://cs.unm.edu/~eschulte/][Eric
Schulte's]] best for an academic personal page, and I wanted to use the
[[http://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html][org-info.js]]

* [2016-08-01 Mon] Removing Stuck Aluminum Seatpost from a Steel Frame :bike:

*** In short:
Use a sodium hydroxide solution with proper protection and
ventilation. Be patient.  Use rubber stoppers to block holes in frame (bottom bracket
and water bottle braze-ons.

*** In long:
My seatpost had been stuck in my steel frame for years.  Fortunately
it was at the proper height, so it didn't bother me.  When my headset
broke and needed to be replaced, I figured I'd take care of the
seatpost at the same time.  I wasted an incredible amount of time
trying to remove the seatpost and ruined my paint in the process which
required a costly repowdering.  This post is to share my experience so
that you don't have to go through the same thing.

**** What didn't work:
1) Freezing
2) Ammonia
3) Pipe wrench with 5 foot bar
4) combinations of the above
5) Tying it between two trees and trying to pull it apart with 3 men and a
   6-1 mechanical advantage system.

**** What did work:
1) Remove everything from the frame except the seatpost
2) Use a hacksaw to remove seat and create hole to pour solution
   down.  Leave as much of the post as possible to reduce splashing,
   while still creating a large hole to pour solution
   down. [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/post_in_frame.jpg][post in frame]], [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/side_post_in_frame.jpg][side view]]
3) Stop up bottom bracket and braze-ons (any holes that will let the
   sodium hydroxide leak out of the seat tube) with rubber or cork
   stoppers.  I got many of different sizes for less than a dollar at
   the hardware store.
4) Place frame in well ventilated area on something to catch any
   spills (I used a plastic sled in my driveway). [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/setup.jpg][setup]]
5) Add sodium hydroxide salt to water (not water to salt).  I did this
   in an old milk jug.  Sodium hydroxide is sold at your local
   hardware store as lye or drain cleaner.  Check chemical composition
   to verify it is NaOH.  I didn't measure the concentration of the
   solution that I used, but you don't want it to be so concentrated
   that it bubbles violently out of seat tube and destroys your paint.  Also,
   the dissolving of NaOH is exothermic and the milk jug will get
   quite warm, or hot if it's very concentrated.
6) Pour solution into seat tube.  The solution needs to be up to the
   top of the tube so that the part of the post inside the tube will
   dissolve, but filling it up this high risks spashes.  Fill up the
   tube part way to make sure there isn't a ton up bubbling and
   splashing, then fill up to top of _tube_ (not post).  If you didn't saw off too
   much of the post, this length of post sticking out of tube will
   help give you a splash buffer.
   [[file:blog_imgs/free_seatpost/bubbling.jpg][I cut mine too short and the paint was destroyed]]
7) Be patient.  My seat post wall was quite thick, at least 2 mm.
   This will take a long time to dissolve.  Wait until the solution is
   finished reacting with aluminum (you can hear the production of
   hydrogen gas), which may take a few hours.  Then pour out the
   solution from your frame and dispose of the dark grey liquid
   (because I wasn't sure if the NaOH was completely used, I added
   vinegar in an attempt to neutralize the base).
8) Repeat steps 5-7 until the post is completely dissolved or you
   can pull the post out.

**** I had apex custom coating in Monona, WI repaint my frame.
They did a great job and the price was lower than everywhere else I
looked, but it still wasn't cheap.  Don't let the NaOH stay on your
frame long!
