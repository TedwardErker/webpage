I use emacs org-mode as the core application for my research. It makes sense to use the great org publishing features to create a website without having to learn many new skills. I had considered using jekyll, but ultimately realized that I could make a website that is just as beautiful and functional with emacs org-mode.

I've looked at tons of websites made with org-mode. I like [Eric Schulte's](http://cs.unm.edu/~eschulte/) best for an academic personal page, and I wanted to use the [org-info.js](http://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html) for a blog with keyboard shortcuts for navigation and search.

If you're not familiar with [org mode](http://orgmode.org/worg/), check it out.

If you are already familiar with org mode, spend twenty minutes reading about [exporting to html](http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#Exporting) and [publishing](http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html). The manual is pretty clear. Once you have a published webpage, check out some css stylesheets from other org sites that you like. [Mine](data/eric.css) is a modified version of the stylesheet of eric schulte, who I asked permission from to use.

I spent no more than 3 hours setting up the site. Deciding that this was the approach I wanted to take and generating the content took a couple days.

You can clone the github [repo](https://github.com/TedwardErker/webpage) to see how I have it set up.

It is great to be able to work on the content of the website in a very familiar way and export it to the internet with one command. Amazing.
