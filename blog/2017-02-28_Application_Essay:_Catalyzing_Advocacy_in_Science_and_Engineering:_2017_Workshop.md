I just applied to the [CASE 2017 Workshop](https://www.aaas.org/page/about-0) in Washington, DC. The application process led to some interesting thoughts, so I thought I'd share the essay.

Update 2017-03-09: I was not accepted.

# Application

"How do we know the earth is 4.5 billion years old?" I loved asking my students this question when I taught high school science. The students (and I) were hard pressed to explain how we know this to be true. Most of us don't have the time to fully understand radiometric dating, let alone collect our own data from meteorites to verify the earth's age. So unless it's a topic we can investigate ourselves, we must simply trust that scientists are following the scientific method and evaluate their results within the context of our own experience.

Trust between scientists and the public is therefore the necessary foundation upon which our society accepts scientific research, incorporates it into policy, and supports more science. The communication of science's benefits to society maintains this trust. Unfortunately, the public and scientists disagree in many critical areas of research, such as genetic modification, climate change, evolution, vaccinations, and the age of the earth [(1)](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/) [(2)](http://www.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx?g_source=SCIENCE&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles). I believe scientists must do more to directly address these discrepancies.

As a scientist I have the incredible opportunity to conduct research that I think will improve society, and I'm honored that the public pays me to do it. I'm making a withdrawal from the bank of public trust and feel strongly that I need to pay it back with interest. I see scientific communication as the way to do so. Effective scientific communication goes way beyond publishing quality work in reputable journals and requires that we place our findings into the public consciousness. I have taught at the university and have led a few guest labs at an area high school, but I want to have a greater impact. The CASE 2017 workshop excites me with the opportunity to learn how to make this impact.

My hope is that CASE will orient me to the landscape of science advocacy, policy, and communication. Despite benefiting from federal funds for science, I am mostly ignorant of how our nation allocates resources to research, and I look forward to CASE demystifying this process. I hope to learn effective methods to communicate science with the public and to discuss with elected officials the value of research for crafting smart policy.

Because scientists understand their work best, they are best suited to advocate for it. CASE will provide a unique opportunity to learn how to be an advocate for science and a leader in strengthening the trust between the scientific community and the public whom we serve. If selected, I would like to work with the other selected graduate student and the graduate school's office of professional development to host a mini-workshop to bring the knowledge and skills from CASE to our campus. I'd like to replicate the Capitol Hill visits at a state level and work to get more graduate students engaged with elected officials from across the state.
