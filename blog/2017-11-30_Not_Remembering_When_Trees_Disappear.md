#  (Not) Remembering When Trees Disappear
2017-11-30

One of the fun parts of my work this semester was knocking on doors and asking people when nearby trees were removed. We wanted to see if the removal of the trees affected the area's air temperature. The residents were super helpful and many gave us very precise and accurate dates for when trees were removed, especially for trees from their own yards. However, many were not sure about street tree removals and so we double checked dates with city Forester's records. (A big thanks goes to to Robi Phetteplace, Marla Eddy and Brittany Prosser for helping with this!) When I did the double checking, I was surprised at how far off many of the resident's guesses were. Below is a table which shows that a resident's best guess of when a street tree was removed is usually off by several months, even when the removal happened recently.

Probably most surprising was a resident who, when asked about a tree, said that no tree ever existed there.

On the other side of the memory spectrum, there was one resident, Sara S, who could exactly date when a tree was removed because she had photo evidence and a good story. Minutes before a hail storm blew through, she told her daughter to move her car inside. Shortly after, the tree the car was parked under split in half. It was removed the next day.

I think the insight to be gained from these informal observations is that people don't remember things unless they are important to them. Even though we see these trees everyday, they aren't important enough for us to remember when they go away. But I'm not judging, I can't even remember my good friend's birthdays, so why should I expect people to be able to recall when a tree was removed?

Our memories just aren't so good, and it's important to remember that when doing research.
