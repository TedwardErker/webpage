# Statistics and Elections
2017-12-05

Statistics can be a powerful tool for identifying fraud in elections. One of my favorite examples comes from the 2011 Russian election. See the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_legislative_election,_2011#Statistics) and this [figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_legislative_election,_2011#/media/File:2011_Duma_votes.svg). The distribution of the votes has very abnormal peaks at every 5%.

The Honduran election that just happened is also suspect to fraud and the economist did a quick analysis to test for any sign of interference in the voting. Check out [their article here](https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21731972-questions-about-integrity-vote-count-will-not-go-away-analysing-juan-orlando) for the details. But the gist of their work investigates changes in the distribution of voting from one day to the next, with the premise being that Hernández's party saw they were losing and stuffed the ballots near the end of voting. I'm curious to see what comes of this. To me it seems like a recount is in order.

Thank you statistics.

## UPDATE

Maybe statistics is not that helpful. The U.S. recognizes Hernández as president despite the irregularities. See the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduran_general_election,_2017). Perhaps statistics can identify a problem with a certain level of confidence, but it cannot solve that problem. These two cases are disappointing, and I'm curious if there are elections where fraud was identified with statistics and this revelation led to a redo.
