[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a probabilistic programming language used for bayesian statistical inference. I got a student scholarship to attend the Stan conference 2018 in Monterey this January.

The view from an airplane is always amazing:

My personal highlight of the conference was meeting and chatting with other attendees at family style meals. It is truly amazing the variety of fields in which Stan is used. I had many productive and enlightening conversations.

Here are few more quick take-aways:

1.  R packages [rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstanarm) and [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_overview.pdf) can help you fit Stan models using R syntax many people may be more comfortable with, such as the lme4 syntax for multilevel models. They can also output the stan code for tweaking.
2.  Fitting customized hierarchical models can be challenging in Stan for a non expert like me. But the flexibility of these models is attractive.
3.  The regularized horseshoe prior is an option for shrinking parameter estimates. I'd like to test it out for some of the problems our lab faces. I don't think it would provide predictive improvements, but it might enhance inference by identifying important variables.
4.  "Our work is unimportant." Andrew Gelman, the lead of the Stan team and final speaker, emphasized this point, that bayesian inference hasn't done much for humanity. It was a humbling and thought-provoking comment to end three days of talking about all the things that we use Stan for. It was a good point for reflection and a reminder that I need to balance my compulsions to do technically correct/advanced/obtuse science with my desire to do science that actually gets done and contributes to society.
5.  Gelman also mentioned that our work can be like a ladder: Scientists must become statisticians to do science, statisticians must become computational statisticians to do statistics, computational statisticians must become software developers &#x2026; and so on. As a scientist who constantly feels like he's in over his head with statistics, I appreciated this point. To achieve our objectives we must stretch ourselves. It's never comfortable to feel like we don't know what we are doing, but how else can we grow?

It was also very beautiful there:
