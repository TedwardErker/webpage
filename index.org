* consider changing to hugo:
https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/
maybe a little noisy?  I think changing the theme would help with that.

knitr rmd exports are pretty clean.  I like to floting toc on the side
that highlights what section of the text the reader is in.

* About
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: firstHeader
:END:
I am a statistical consultant (starting March 2019) and a research
fellow (ending 2019).  As a consultant in the [[https://calslab.cals.wisc.edu/stat-consulting/][CALS Statistical
Consulting Lab]], I assist researchers in data analysis and study
design.  As a research fellow, I study urban ecology.

* Research
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: research
:END:

I seek to understand the interaction between humans and the
environment in the places where most of us live: cities.  More
specifically, I'm interested in how urban forests affect urban
climate, building energy use, and carbon emissions, and in turn how
the urban environment affects the health and productivity of the urban
forest.  Madison, WI is my home and case study.

I strive to make all my work fully reproducible using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][emacs]] [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].

* COMMENT Teaching and Learning

While teaching high school, I experienced the joy and challenges of
student learning.  I developed the skills that made me a successful
teaching assistant, and that I hope to continue to develop in higher education.

It's truly satisfying to help students grow and build confidence in their
skills.  I am excited to be pursuing a career where I can teach about
topics that inspire me, and that I hope will inspire my students.

I limit my presence on social media to prevent distraction, but that
makes it harder to stay in touch.  If you are an old friend or former
student who found this website, please email me.  I'd love to catch up
and get a cup of joe if you're in town.
