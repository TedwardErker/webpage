I NEED TO WORK ON THIS

I seek to understand the interaction between humans and the
environment in our most common habitat: cities.  More
specifically, I'm interested in how urban forests affect urban
climate, building energy use, and carbon emissions.  I use Madison, WI
as a case study.

I limit my presence on social media because I find it too distracting.
The extra focus is great, but it's harder to stay in touch.  If you
are an old friend or former student who found this website, please
email me.  I'd love to catch up on life and drink some coffee together
if you're in town.
