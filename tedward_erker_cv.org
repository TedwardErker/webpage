** Jul 2017
*Software Carpentry Volunteer*
*** COMMENT details
- Software Carpentry is a workshop designed to teach basic computing
  skills to researchers
- I volunteered two days to help teach graduate students the basics of
  the command line, version control (git), and python.

* Service to Community
**  Fall 2014 and Fall 2015
*Guest Lab Instructor, Sustainability by the Numbers, Shabazz High School*

*** COMMENT details
- Twice, I conducted a two day lab exercise in a sustainability
  oriented math class exploring the potential for urban trees to offset carbon emissions.

- Each year, I conducted a 2 day lab for about 20 students in a math class focused on
  sustainability at Malcolm Shabazz City High school, an alternative
  high school in Madison.
- The lab consisted of identifying the species and measuring the
  diameter at breast height of all the trees on the school's
  campus.  Students then used allometric equations to predict carbon storage and
  sequestration by trees, and compared this carbon to the carbon emitted by
  student to determine how many trees would be required to offset
  their emissions.
** Fall 2017
*Guest Lab Instructor, AP Environmental Studies, East High School*


*** COMMENT details
- I assisted with a field trip to the Madison School Forest for 85
  students in the AP environmental studies class at Madison East High
  School.
- Students used a clinometer and diameter at breast height tape to
  measure forest trees, they estimated carbon content of the trees,
  and they compared this to the carbon emissions caused by their
  transportation to and from school.
