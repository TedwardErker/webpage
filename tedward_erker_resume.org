* Summary of Qualifications and Skills
[[https://www.stat.wisc.edu/masters-biometry][Biometry M.S.]] and Forestry Ph.D. (expected spring 2019) with 5 years
of research and data analysis experience and 2 years of high school
teaching experience.  Comfortable with a wide range of statistical
methods including generalized linear models and tree-based
methods. Driven to understand complex problems and distill key
findings for nonexpert audiences via fully reproducible reports and
compelling figures.  Independently motivated. A positive, constructive
team member and leader.  Passionate about working in education.
** COMMENT

Statistical methods I have implemented: GLMs, GAMs, mixed effects/
multilevel models, partial least squares regression, elastic net, principal
components analysis, random forests, support vector machines, boosted
regression trees.


GLMs, GAMs, shrinkage and dimension reduction,
tree-based methods, and working with dependent data and large datasets
in R.


shrinkage methods, high dimension, large data, dependent data.  some bayesian.

Computing: Daily use of R, familiarity with python and Stan.
