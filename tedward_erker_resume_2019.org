** COMMENT details

I represented graduate student interests at monthly department
  meetings, communicated relevant departmental changes to fellow
  graduate students, and organized professional development events and
  the weekly department social.

- Software Carpentry is a workshop designed to teach basic computing
  skills to researchers
- I volunteered two days to help teach graduate students the basics of
  the command line, version control (git), and python.

** COMMENT details
- Twice, I conducted a two day lab exercise in a sustainability
  oriented math class exploring the potential for urban trees to offset carbon emissions.

- Each year, I conducted a 2 day lab for about 20 students in a math class focused on
  sustainability at Malcolm Shabazz City High school, an alternative
  high school in Madison.
- The lab consisted of identifying the species and measuring the
  diameter at breast height of all the trees on the school's
  campus.  Students then used allometric equations to predict carbon storage and
  sequestration by trees, and compared this carbon to the carbon emitted by
  student to determine how many trees would be required to offset
  their emissions.

** COMMENT details
- I assisted with a field trip to the Madison School Forest for 85
  students in the AP environmental studies class at Madison East High
  School.
- Students used a clinometer and diameter at breast height tape to
  measure forest trees, they estimated carbon content of the trees,
  and they compared this to the carbon emissions caused by their
  transportation to and from school.

I am applying to the applied statistician position in the CALS
Biometry Statistical Consulting Facility because I'm passionate about
people and statistics.  I know first-hand the dedication researchers
have for their work, and I'm excited by the opportunity to help them
apply statistical methods to gain insight into new problems.  From my
time as a student statistical consultant, I learned the process is
driven first by human considerations, meeting people at their level of
knowledge and recognizing their feelings towards statistics.  From
Nick Keuler, my consulting supervisor, I learned the importance
of listening. When given space to talk, researchers not only clarify
their own thinking, but also identify objectives and needs for the
consultant to address.  My years as a high school teacher and a TA,
especially for Stat 572, taught me that building relationships based
on trust and respect is the foundation of success, learning, and the
proper application of statistics.

My statistical training at UW-Madison and my dedication to constant
improvement would serve me well as a consultant.  Coursework taught me
how to think probabilistically and how to apply a variety of methods
such as spatial statistics and multilevel models.  My research in
forestry has extended the breadth and depth of methods I use.  For
example, I have compared several machine learning algorithms for
classification and analyzed data with more predictors than
observations.  My biometry project uses Stan to fit nonlinear Bayesian
multilevel models of urban tree growth.  I know how to meet the varied
needs of researchers including modeling for inference, prediction and
experimental design, and how to provide advice on statistical
limitations and assumptions.  When clients need or request methods
unfamiliar to me, I look forward to diving into a new challenge and
learning.

I have extensive experiences working with large datasets, multiple
programming languages, and reproducible workflows. For my
dissertation, I classified 4 terabytes imagery at the UW Center for
High Throughput Computing.  I have used many R packages for big data
and also use smart data management techniques to ease the
computational burden.  I work routinely with R and am familiar with
several other programming languages including Stan and SAS.  I have
not used SAS much outside of coursework, but I would enjoy the
opportunity to improve my SAS skills to meet the needs of clients.
All my work is fully reproducible and version controlled, and I love
sharing literate programming with others.  Outreach seminars on best
statistical and data visualization practices would leverage my
excellent teaching and presenting skills.

I am very grateful to be considered for this opportunity and am
confident I have the skills and mindset to contribute to the
success of CALS Biometry.

** cover letter
My first attempt at data-driven improvement in student achievement was
in 2010.  As a first year biology and chemistry teacher at a charter
school in St. Louis, I wanted my students to grow at least 3 points on
the ACT, an ambitious push towards college readiness.  I administered
tests quarterly, tracked students' performance, and created daily
practice problems for target standards.  Working with this data, I
encountered the challenges inherent in measuring student learning.
How reliable are the tests that I'm putting together from old ACTs?
What to do about missing students?  How much of my students'
performance is even atributable to me, the teacher?  And how can I use
these results to make my teaching more effective?

I loved my high school students, but I wanted to teach college level
courses.  So in 2013 I moved to Madison to pursue a PhD in Forestry
and a Masters in Biometry.  My proclivity for data analysis followed
me and was honed at the university.  The highlights of my statistical
training were a multilevel modeling course, being the teaching
assistant for a graduate level statistics course for natural science
majors, and statistical consulting.  Relevant skills from my PhD work
include working with large datasets (terabytes of imagery) in R, using
machine learning algorithms (e.g. random forests), writing literate
programs for reproducible research, and mastering the visual
display of information for effective communication. As I am nearing
the completion of my PhD and considering the needs of my family, I'm
reconsidering my tolerance for the itinerant academic career path, and
I'm exploring the option of staying in Madison.

The intelligent use of the correct data will help create a better
education system, and by extension, a better world.  I want to join
Education Analytics to work to build this

This is the path
I want to work to build.  Education Analytics is a clear leader in
this field and I would be very excited to join your team.



I should write in a way that recognizes that some skills are very
difficult to measure and maybe not worth the effort ..  Just imply
that standardized tests are _part_ of the solution.
not all things can be measure








working with others.....


computing
statistics
spatial
multilevel models
consulting - clients with varying levels of statistical background.
TA for graduate level statistics course 572

- working with large datasets (
  - center for high throughput computing
- skilled in R, tidyverse
- machine learning (random forests, support vector machines, boosted
  regression trees) for image classification work.
- making figures.
  - visual display of data for effective communication.

abilty to work hard (longish hours and extra time are what I am used to).


it's where I learned I loved to



make my own questions, even have them analyze the results of the test
as practice

by making it longitudinal some of the analysis issues go away.

My number one priority for my work is taht is working towards a
greater good and therefore personally fulfilling.


I buy into the mission of EA  improving education.  that is our future.

Never having taken
a math class in college, I took calc 3 over the summer (for no credit)
so I could pursue the biometry masters
