I am applying to the applied statistician position in the CALS
Biometry Statistical Consulting Facility because I'm passionate about
people and statistics.  I know first-hand the dedication researchers
have for their work, and I'm excited by the opportunity to help them
apply statistical methods to gain insight into new problems.  From my
time as a student statistical consultant, I learned the process is
driven first by human considerations, meeting people at their level of
knowledge and recognizing their feelings towards statistics.  From
Nick Keuler, my consulting supervisor, I learned the importance
of listening. When given space to talk, researchers not only clarify
their own thinking, but also identify objectives and needs for the
consultant to address.  My years as a high school teacher and a TA,
especially for Stat 572, taught me that building relationships based
on trust and respect is the foundation of success, learning, and the
proper application of statistics.

My statistical training at UW-Madison and my dedication to constant
improvement would serve me well as a consultant.  Coursework taught me
how to think probabilistically and how to apply a variety of methods
such as spatial statistics and multilevel models.  My research in
forestry has extended the breadth and depth of methods I use.  For
example, I have compared several machine learning algorithms for
classification and analyzed data with more predictors than
observations.  My biometry project uses Stan to fit nonlinear Bayesian
multilevel models of urban tree growth.  I know how to meet the varied
needs of researchers including modeling for inference, prediction and
experimental design, and how to provide advice on statistical
limitations and assumptions.  When clients need or request methods
unfamiliar to me, I look forward to diving into a new challenge and
learning.

I have extensive experiences working with large datasets, multiple
programming languages, and reproducible workflows. For my
dissertation, I classified 4 terabytes imagery at the UW Center for
High Throughput Computing.  I have used many R packages for big data
and also use smart data management techniques to ease the
computational burden.  I work routinely with R and am familiar with
several other programming languages including Stan and SAS.  I have
not used SAS much outside of coursework, but I would enjoy the
opportunity to improve my SAS skills to meet the needs of clients.
All my work is fully reproducible and version controlled, and I love
sharing literate programming with others.  Outreach seminars on best
statistical and data visualization practices would leverage my
excellent teaching and presenting skills.

I am very grateful to be considered for this opportunity and am
confident I have the skills and mindset to contribute to the
success of CALS Biometry.
