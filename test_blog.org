The best way to get to work is by ice.

* 2018-01-13 Sat STANCon 2018

[[http://mc-stan.org/][Stan]] is a probabilistic programming language used for bayesian
statistical inference. I got a student scholarship to attend the Stan
conference 2018 in Monterey this January.

The view from an airplane is always amazing:

My personal highlight of the conference was meeting and chatting with
other attendees at family style meals.  It is truly amazing the
variety of fields in which Stan is used.  I had many productive and
enlightening conversations.

 Here are few more quick take-aways:

1. R packages [[http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstanarm][rstanarm]] and [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_overview.pdf][brms]] can help you fit Stan models using R
   syntax many people may be more comfortable with, such as the lme4
   syntax for multilevel models.  They can also output the stan code
   for tweaking.
2. Fitting customized hierarchical models can be challenging in Stan
   for a non expert like me.  But the flexibility of these models is
   attractive.
3. The regularized horseshoe prior is an option for shrinking
   parameter estimates.  I'd like to test it out for some of the
   problems our lab faces.  I don't think it would provide predictive
   improvements, but it might enhance inference by identifying
   important variables.
4. "Our work is unimportant." Andrew Gelman, the lead of the Stan
   team and final speaker, emphasized this point, that bayesian
   inference hasn't done much for humanity.  It was a humbling and
   thought-provoking comment to end three days of talking about
   all the things that we use Stan for.  It was a good point for
   reflection and a reminder that I need to balance my compulsions to
   do technically correct/advanced/obtuse science with my desire to do
   science that actually gets done and contributes to society.
4. Gelman also mentioned that our work can be like a ladder:
   Scientists must become statisticians to do science, statisticians
   must become computational statisticians to do statistics,
   computational statisticians must become software developers ... and
   so on.  As a scientist who constantly feels like he's in over his
   head with statistics, I appreciated this point.  To achieve our
   objectives we must stretch ourselves.  It's never comfortable to
   feel like we don't know what we are doing, but how else can we grow?

It was also very beautiful there:
